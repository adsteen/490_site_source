<h1>Review of data structures</h1>
<p>In lecture on Wednesday, Sept 9, we discussed a key data structure in R: <strong>vectors</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. There are three important rules for vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are <strong>1-dimensional</strong>: think of them like a column of values.</li>
<li>They are <strong>ordered</strong>: there is a first element, a second element, etc.</li>
<li>They contain <strong>a single data type</strong>: a vector can be integer, double, logical, or character, but they can’t be a mix of those. If a vector looks like it has a mix of data types, that’s because it has been <em>coerced</em> to a more general type. For instance, <code>c(7, "aardvark")</code> will be coerced to a character vector: the number <code>7</code> will be converted to the character <code>"7"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a two other data structures which are frequently used in base R, but not in the tidyverse:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matrix</strong>: a 2-dimensional vector. This follows the same rules as vectors, but it has rows and columns.</li>
<li><strong>List</strong>: I think of this like a bag, into which you can throw any data structure you want. (Lists are ordered, like vectors, so maybe it is an unusually well-ordered bag?) The first element of a list might be a character vector, the second might be a integer matrix, and the third might be another list (which might, in turn, contain more lists)! These are great when you have to keep track of non-parallel information about something. For instance, a linear model object contains the coefficients of the linear model, the residuals, and all sorts of other information that comes in different data types and different lengths. The <code>lm()</code> function therefore returns a special kind of list to store all that information.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Data frames and tibbles</h1>
<p>A data frame is a special kind of list. Data frames must obey two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list can only contain <strong>vectors</strong></li>
<li>Each vector must be the same <strong>length</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, data frames act like a rectangular table. For instance, here are the first six rows of <code>mtcars</code>, a data frame that is built into R’s <strong>datasets</strong> package, which is autoloaded when you start R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(mtcars) # head() prints the first 6 rows of adata frame</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1</code></pre>

<h2>Creating data frames</h2>
<p>We can create data frames manually from vectors using the <code>data.frame()</code> function. Recall that we can use <code>c()</code> (concatenate) to build vectors. We name the columns of the data frame using the arguments of the function: in the example below <code>x.col = x</code> says "take the vector x, and name it <code>x.col</code> in the new data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- c(1, 3, 5)
y &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)
d &lt;- data.frame(x.col = x, y.col = y)
d</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   x.col y.col
## 1     1     a
## 2     3     c
## 3     5     d</code></pre>
<p><code>d</code> looks like a data frame when it is printed out, but we really should check to be sure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(d)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    3 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ x.col: num  1 3 5
##  $ y.col: chr  &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>obs.</code> (short for observations) corresponds to ‘rows’ and <code>variables</code> corresponds to ‘columns’.</p>
<p>Of course, it is pretty rare that we want to create data frames by hand<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. More often, we read in a file, for instance a text file. The functions in the <strong>readr</strong> package like <code>read_csv()</code> (which reads a comma-separated value file).</p>

<h1>Data frames vs tibbles</h1>
<p>The tidyverse is built around data frames. Basically, tidyverse wants you to use data frames whenever possible. Because data frames are so important, tidyverse defines a special kind of data frame: the <strong>tibble</strong>. (The name comes the function <code>tbl_df</code>, or table-data-frame).</p>
<p>For our purposes, tibbles are equivalent to data frames. Tibbles contain a little more information when printed out, and protect you a little more when you do something silly to them. But for our purposes, whenever you hear “tibble”, you can think “data frame”.</p>
