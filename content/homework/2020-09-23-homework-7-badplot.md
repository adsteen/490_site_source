Homework 7 is due Wednesday, October 7.

<!--more-->

Your homework is to create two version of similar plots, using any dataset you choose. You must create the plots using **ggplot2**, post-processing with Adobe Illustrator or similar is not allowed. This homework is a contest, and the winner will win a prize to be disclosed.

Please submit your homework by posting a markdown document containing the plots, the code you used to create them, and your discussion of the plot to github. Please also upload the underlying data, so that I could re-create your 

The first plot should be as bad as possible. Your reading from last week (as well as Claus Wilke's textbook and many other data visualization guides you may find) describe the many ways that a plot cab become misleading, difficult to interpret, or or just plain ugly, and you should use all of the tools that you can. Please try to make me, a person who cares a great deal about high-quality data visualization, cry.

You should explain in text all of the ways in which the bad plot is bad. Bullet points are fine, but clearly articulate each principle of data visualization that you have broken.

The second plot should be based on the same or similar data to the first plot, but it should be reasonably good. (It doesn't need to be a perfect plot, just a plausibly-decent one).  Write briefly about why this is a successful plot.

## Badplot rules

* All plots must be made in **ggplot2**, with code visible in the Rmarkdown document.
* The data must be visible. 
* The good plot and the bad plot should be based on the same, or similar, data. One important determinant of a good plot is that it contains data that should be plotted. It is OK to make the bad plot bad by basing it on bad data, but you should base the good plot on related, good data.
* I will post the results on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/drdrewsteen). **Please notify me if you would prefer not to have your plots posted publicly**. That is fine, but I need to know.

## Examples

This the winning plot from last year, by Rihanna Moore. Truly reprehensible, although I'm sure that with enough creativity and will to succeed, you can make one worse.

This plot - while truly reprehensible - falls afoul of the rule that the data must be visible. Here, the margins are adjusted so wide that the data are compressed into a nearly-invisible green stripe. (This plot is the work of [Chris Cook](https://adsteen.github.io/authors/ccook62/), and complied with the contest rules at the time).

This plot is a nice example of one in which the data are visible but uninterpretable. This plot would be allowable under this year's rules.
