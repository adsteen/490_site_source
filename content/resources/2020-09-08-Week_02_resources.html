<p>Resources for week 2.
<!--more-->
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/">R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This week has a bunch of R basics. Chapters <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html">1</a> and <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html">4</a> of R for Data Science are a good place to start. However, I would like you all to practice your Git/Github skills by adding introductory references to this list.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/adsteen/490_site_source">https://github.com/adsteen/490_site_source</a>, which contains the source code for this website</p></li>
<li><p>Press the “Fork” link to make a copy of that Git “repo” (repository)</p></li>
<li><p>On your version of this repository on the GitHub website (it’ll be labeled <code>your-user-name/490_site_source</code>, navigate to <code>contents/resources/2020-09-08-Week_02-resources.Rmd</code></p></li>
<li><p>Press the little pencil button, on the top-right of the code, to edit it</p></li>
<li><p>Add a link to a resource. To make a nice hyperlink, type the text that goes into the link followed by the URL like this: <code>[Google](https://www.google.com)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Press the green “commit changes” button at the bottom of the screen</p></li>
<li><p>Press the “pull requests” tab near the top of the screen, and then press the green “new pull request” button. Add a message in the box, and type “create pull request”. This will send a request to me to incorporate your changes into the git repo.</p></li>

</ul>
