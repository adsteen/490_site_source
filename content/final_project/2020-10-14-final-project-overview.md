Overview of the final project.

<!--more-->

# Project overview

Final projects may be submitted by groups of up to 4 students, or by individuals. Feel free to self-organize into new groups.

Groups/individuals will negotiate a draft project prospectus with me. For the prospectus, imagine me as a potential client for your data analysis consulting firm. The prospectus is the document you're using to convince me to buy your service.

An agreed-upon project prospectus is due Oct 16. The prospectus will contain four main pieces of information:

* Group members
* A description of the overall purpose of the project: what will your project do, and how?
* A description of  major elements of the proposal. You may propose new elements, beyond what I have listed below
* A description of why the project is valuable.

A major consideration of my acceptance of the prospectus is that it be an appropriate size, which I will qualitatively judge based on the number of students working on the project, the elements of the project as described below, and the difficulty of each element. For instance, it might be appropriate for a single student to create a project that will consist of a package that contains a few different functions and a few trivial unit tests (low degree of difficulty), including one function that interacts with a SQL database (much higher degree of difficulty). A group of four students would need to include considerably more elements.



## Possible elements: 

1. Create a package with proper documentation
2. Add unit tests to a package
3. Use SQL
4. Create a shiny application
5. Create a website for your project using blogdown and gh-pages
6. Use a notebook
7. Call a language other than R
8. Use a shell script
9. Metaprogramming / using nonstandard evaluation
10. Collaborate on project using github
11. 11. Write and deploy a real blog post (or manuscript) describing the scientific importance of your analysis
12. ...?
